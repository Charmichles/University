# University

Some small to medium sized projects I did during the first two years of the Computer Science program at the University of Bucharest.

This was before I learned how to properly use git, so most of these are uploaded in bulk.

My favorites are:
* **The Poet** - a little pygame app which generates random poems with a given structure of verses and stanzas, there's a link to the demo in the folder's readme.

* **Virtual Piano** - a webpage made using Node.js with the main feature being a playable piano utilizing the keyboard. I also implemented a minigame for playing different chords generated by the computer in a given time.

* **Checkers** - my first pygame app for playing checkers with different algorithms for the computer-controlled player (random moves, min-max, alpha-beta)

I'm working on adding videos with demos for all of these.

Also, there's an usable Fibbonaci Heap implementation - **fibbonacci-heap-py** - which is used in the **graph-MST-py** folder which contains some class definitions, most important being WeightedGraph which implements optimized MST algorithms and Dijkstra.
